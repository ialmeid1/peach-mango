 **reference sheet** that captures everything we’ve built: the layered architecture, the motifs, and the canonical contract patterns. It’s meant to be something you can drop into your IndeX, dashboards, or codex without modification.

# **Hospitality Engineering + Motif Architecture  
Reference Sheet**

## **1. Layered Architecture (Conceptual Stack)**

### **Lantern — Experience Layer**  
- Guest comfort, sensory envelope, emotional tone  
- Temperature, lighting, acoustics, water pressure  
- Defines what “good” feels like  

### **Hand — Interaction Layer**  
- Staff, agents, service gestures, routing  
- Guest requests → triage → resolution  
- Digital interfaces (apps, kiosks, room controls)  

### **Gear — Workflow Layer**  
- SOPs, runbooks, preventive maintenance  
- Work orders, escalation paths, automation triggers  
- Ensures rhythm, precision, and repeatability  

### **Root — Data & Infrastructure Layer**  
- HVAC, electrical, plumbing, fire systems  
- BMS, sensors, telemetry, asset lifecycle  
- Physical truth and system reliability  

---

## **2. Cross‑Cutting Concerns**  
- **Identity & Access** — who can operate what  
- **Observability** — logs, sensors, telemetry  
- **Governance & Standards** — brand, safety, compliance  
- **Energy & Sustainability** — efficiency, optimization  

---

## **3. Canonical Contract (Motif‑Infused Template)**

```
Layer: <Lantern | Hand | Gear | Root>
Motif: <Symbolic qualities of this layer>

Purpose:
The essential function this layer contributes to the whole system.

Inputs:
- Upstream signals, intents, or data required for operation

Outputs:
- Downstream artifacts, transformed states, or decisions

Responsibilities:
- Core duties this layer must always perform
- Transformations or validations it owns
- Guarantees it provides to adjacent layers

Non‑Responsibilities:
- Tasks explicitly owned by other layers
- Decisions outside this layer’s symbolic domain
- Any action that violates layer boundaries

Invariants:
- Rules that must always hold true for this layer to remain valid
- Structural, semantic, or safety constraints
```

---

## **4. Example Canonical Contract (Gear / Workflow Layer)**

```
Layer: Gear (Workflow Layer)
Motif: Precision, Rhythm, Reliability

Purpose:
Translate intent into repeatable, verifiable action with minimal friction.

Inputs:
- Signals from Hand (Interaction)
- Telemetry from Root (Infrastructure)
- Standards from Lantern (Experience)

Outputs:
- Completed tasks with verification artifacts
- Updated asset or state records
- Escalation signals back to Hand

Responsibilities:
- Maintain SOPs, runbooks, and schedules
- Ensure precision via checklists, logs, and confirmations
- Route work to the correct agent with clear SLAs
- Harmonize upstream intent with downstream constraints

Non‑Responsibilities:
- Guest-facing emotional experience (Lantern)
- Direct physical system manipulation (Root)
- Service gestures or communication (Hand)

Invariants:
- Every action produces a traceable artifact
- No workflow executes without an owner
- Escalation paths remain deterministic and documented
```

## **5. Motif Meanings (Your Symbolic Backbone)**

| Motif | Layer | Meaning | Domain Function |
|-------|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Lantern** | Experience | Guidance, clarity, emotional tone | Defines what “good” feels like |
| **Hand** | Interaction | Touch, service, routing | Connects people, agents, and systems |
| **Gear** | Workflow | Rhythm, precision, reliability | Executes intent through structured action |
| **Root** | Infrastructure | Stability, truth, foundation | Provides physical/technical reality |

---

## **6. How the Layers Interact**

- Lantern sets expectations → Hand interprets → Gear executes → Root sustains  
- Root informs Gear with telemetry → Gear updates Hand → Hand shapes Lantern  
- Each layer has strict boundaries but constant communication  

This is the architecture you can reuse across **hospitality**, **consulting**, **asset management**, **HomeAssistant**, **creative routines**, and any future domain.
